**Project Description:**

This Rust project demonstrates key concepts of ownership, borrowing, and references. It includes a function `concatenate_strings` that takes two string slices, concatenates them, and returns a new `String`. The main function initializes two `String` variables, passes their references to `concatenate_strings`, and prints the concatenated result. The program ensures proper management of memory and data by utilizing Rust's strict ownership rules, preventing common bugs related to data handling. The project is ideal for understanding Rust's memory safety features through practical implementation.

## Project Description

This Rust project illustrates ownership, borrowing, and references by implementing a function `concatenate_strings` that merges two string slices and returns a new `String`. The main function creates two `String` variables, references them in the function call, and outputs the concatenated result. This program is designed to highlight Rustâ€™s memory safety principles and provides a practical example of handling data efficiently in Rust.
